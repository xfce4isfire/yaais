# yaais
yet another arch install script
---------------------------------
i made yaais mostly as a project to see if i can work with bash, but it ended up as a nice little minimalistic and simplistic install script, just like arch is meant to be.
to clarify:
yaais-uefi.sh is for uefi systems
yaais-legacy.sh is for legacy bios systems
dont mix them up
